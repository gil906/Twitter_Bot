# Twitter Bot - Auto Reply

This project creates a Twitter bot that automatically replies to mentions or direct messages on Twitter. The bot utilizes the Tweepy library to interact with the Twitter API and perform actions based on predefined rules or triggers. The bot can be customized to reply with predefined messages, provide helpful information, or even perform specific tasks based on the content of the incoming messages.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or above
- Tweepy library (`pip install tweepy`)
- Twitter Developer account and API credentials

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the code as a ZIP file.

2. Sign up for a Twitter Developer account and create a new app to obtain your API credentials (consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access token secret).

3. Open the `bot.py` file and replace the placeholder values ("YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY", "YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET", "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN", and "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET") with your actual Twitter API credentials.

4. Customize the reply message in the `reply_text` variable to suit your bot's behavior. You can modify it to include the user's handle, personalized greetings, or any other desired response.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the bot script by executing the following command:

   ```shell
   python bot.py
